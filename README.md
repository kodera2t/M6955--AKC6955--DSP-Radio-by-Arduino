M6955--AKC6955--DSP-Radio-by-Arduino
====================================

M6955 (AKC6955) DSP Radio by Arduino IDE. Simply connecting Arduino A4/A5 (SDA/SCL) to AKC6955 (M6955) and I2C character display enables wideband receiver. Rotary encoder for frequency tuning should be connected to A2 and A4, and banc switch (changing MW, SW, FM ) should be connected to A3 with appropriate pull-up resistor.
